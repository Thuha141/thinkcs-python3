# thinkcs-python3
I have studied Python using this book: how to think like a computer scientist. This is awesome book to understand basic concepts in Python. 
Some solutions for exercises about using turtle are wrong. I'm still hunger to know the exact solutions for them. So feel free to pull request. Thank you
